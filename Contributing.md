# Contributing

* We'll be using a standard pull request code reviewing procedure for development.
  * There will be separate branches for each feature that needs to be developed (Example: `authorization`). Upon completion of implementing the feature, we will submit a PR for merging the code into the `master` branch.
  * It is expected for each developer to have a "sub-branch" for each "feature branch". When working on a feature, be sure to create a branch with the style of `dev-<your-name>-feature`. Example: `dev-joe-authorization`.
  * Submit a PR for merging into your respective feature branch when you have completed your task, making sure other developers in your team have reviewed the PR and then merged it into the feature branch.
